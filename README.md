# ðŸ§ª COVID-19 Data Analysis â€“ India ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡³

---



## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

This is a small data analysis project using Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn) to explore COVID-19 trends in India. The project focuses on understanding cases, deaths, recoveries, and vaccination progress using time-series analysis and visualization.

## ðŸ“‚ Dataset Info

- **Source:** [Our World in Data - COVID Deaths](https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths)
- **GitHub Repository:** [COVID-19 Dataset on GitHub](https://github.com/owid/covid-19-data)
- Key columns used:
    - `date`
    - `new_cases`, `total_cases`
    - `new_deaths`, `total_deaths`
    - `people_vaccinated`, `people_fully_vaccinated`

## ðŸ§­ Steps Performed

### ðŸ”¹ Step 1: Loading the Dataset  
- Used `pd.read_csv()` to load data into `india_df`.

### ðŸ”¹ Step 2â€“5: Data Cleaning & Exploration  
- Checked missing values
- Explored summary statistics (`.info()`, `.describe()`)

### ðŸ”¹ Step 6: Total COVID-19 Cases Over Time  
- Line plot of `total_cases` over `date`.

### ðŸ”¹ Step 7: Daily New COVID-19 Cases  
- Created a `daily_new_cases` column.
- Plotted trends to highlight peaks/waves.

### ðŸ”¹ Step 8: Correlation Heatmap  
- Visualized correlations between total cases, deaths, and vaccination progress.

### ðŸ”¹ Step 9â€“10: Recovery and Death Trends  
- Tracked how total and new deaths evolved over time.

### ðŸ”¹ Step 11-12: Vaccination Progress  
- Plotted people vaccinated and fully vaccinated over time.
- Calculated % of Indian population vaccinated.

### ðŸ”¹ Step 13: Testing Trends  
- Skipped due to lack of testing data.

### ðŸ”¹ Step 14: Conclusion and Insights  
- Vaccination had clear impact on reducing case/death rates.
- Clear spikes in daily cases highlighted key COVID waves.
- Strong correlation between total cases and deaths.
